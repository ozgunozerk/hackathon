I investigate cryptocurrencies and have academic publications on Bitcoin\n                                    markets.

Will pass.” And sites like NBA Top Shot (where you can buy, sell and trade\n                                    digital\n                                    NBA cards) have individual cards selling for over US$200,000.\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital file with verified identity and ownership.\n                                    This\n                                    verification is done using blockchain technology. Blockchain technology, simply put,\n                                    is\n                                    an un-hackable system based on the mathematics of cryptography.

The previous paragraph is a parody (if such is possible) of the hype\n                                    that\n                                    in the first half of has come to surround non-fungible tokens. Indeed, the hype has\n                                    become so overpowering that it may even defy parody. Non-fungible tokens can have\n                                    legitimacy, and I’ll discuss how that can be at the end of this article.

In other words, they’re just strings of bits. As a string\n                                    of\n                                    bits, a digital file has a fixed number of bits, with the bit at any location in the\n                                    string having a definite value of either zero or one.\n                                </li>\n                            </ol>\n                            <h4>Collect personal information</h4>\n                            <ol>\n                                <li>\n                                    Fungibility is the ability of an asset to be interchanged with other individual\n                                    assets\n                                    of the same kind; it implies equal value between the assets.
